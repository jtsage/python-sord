VII. The Fairies

   The Fairies are a nice addition to LORD, with a neat ANSI intro.

    A. Blessings

   Ask for a blessing, and ye shall receive.

     i. A Kiss

   A Kiss from Teesha or Nolan heals you.

    ii. Horses

   Horses take you directly to the Dark Cloak Tavern, handy if you want
 to change your Profession without having to wait until you find the
|tavern at random.  You can also lose your horse in a forest fight: [2]

| "Prepare to die, fool!" X screams.
| He takes a Death Crystal from his cloak and throws it at you!
| Your horse moves its huge body to intercept the crystal.

| YOUR HORSE IS VAPORIZED!

| Tears of anger flow down your cheeks.  Your valiant steed must be
|  avenged.
| YOU PUMMEL X WITH BLOWS!
| A few seconds later, your adversary is dead.
| You bury your horse in a small clearing.  The best friend you ever
|  had.

   iii. Sad Stories

   Sad stories turn your tear into a gem.

    iv. Fairy Lore

   Fairy Lore gets you an amount of experience depending on your level.

     v. Flowers

   Arranging and Reading flowers work like talking at the Inn.  Just as
 a way to talk to other players.  If this gets too long, you might want
 to manually trim the GARDEN.TXT file, but don't delete it!

    B. Catching a Fairy

   Catching a fairy is what you should try if you have gems, don't need
|to be healed, already have a horse, or want to kill the Dragon. [1]

     i. If You Miss

   If you miss, you grab a thornberry bush, and go down to 1 hit point.

    ii. If You Catch One

   If you do catch one, it will revive you the next time you die.
 Be careful though!  Fairies will escape from your pocket when you're
 sleeping, so they're only good for the day you catch them.
   Also, fairies have another -- more secret -- function...  Read on!
